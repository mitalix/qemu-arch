I installed archlinux into qemu successfully (I could install from the network), but would not boot up. So, I downloaded a premade archlinux virtual machine and booted up on qemu. Using user network and host translation I can ssh into the running image. Even while I have set the variables http_proxy=proxy.company.com:1234 and https_proxy=proxy.company.com:1234, I am not able to upgrade (pacman -Syu). I get some kind of TLS timeout errors.




It sounds like you're encountering TLS timeout errors when trying to run pacman -Syu on your Arch Linux virtual machine in QEMU, likely due to network proxy issues. Since you're using a company proxy (proxy.company.com:1234) and user-mode networking with host translation in QEMU, let's troubleshoot and resolve this step-by-step.
Possible Causes
Proxy Configuration: The http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables may not be correctly configured or propagated to pacman.

QEMU User-Mode Networking: QEMU's user-mode networking (SLiRP) may not fully support proxy settings or may have connectivity limitations.

TLS/SSL Issues: The TLS timeout could be due to certificate issues, proxy interception, or network restrictions.

Pacman Configuration: Pacman may not be honoring the proxy settings or may require additional configuration.

Firewall/Proxy Restrictions: Your company's proxy might be blocking or timing out certain connections.

Steps to Resolve
1. Verify Proxy Environment Variables
Ensure the proxy variables are correctly set and accessible to pacman. Run the following in the terminal where you execute pacman:
bash

echo $http_proxy
echo $https_proxy

If they are not set or incorrect, set them again:
bash

export http_proxy="http://proxy.company.com:1234"
export https_proxy="http://proxy.company.com:1234"

To make these persistent across sessions, add them to your shell configuration (e.g., ~/.bashrc or /etc/environment for global settings):
bash

echo 'export http_proxy=http://proxy.company.com:1234' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export https_proxy=http://proxy.company.com:1234' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

2. Configure Pacman to Use the Proxy
Pacman itself may not automatically use the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables. You can configure a proxy in /etc/pacman.conf or use a tool like wget (which pacman relies on for downloads) to respect proxy settings.
Check if wget is honoring the proxy by testing a download:
bash

wget -S https://archlinux.org

If wget fails with a TLS timeout, it confirms the proxy or network issue. Configure wget to use the proxy by editing ~/.wgetrc or /etc/wgetrc:
bash

echo 'use_proxy = on' >> ~/.wgetrc
echo 'http_proxy = http://proxy.company.com:1234' >> ~/.wgetrc
echo 'https_proxy = http://proxy.company.com:1234' >> ~/.wgetrc

Then retry pacman -Syu.
3. Check QEMU Networking
QEMU's user-mode networking (SLiRP) is simple but limited and may not handle complex proxy setups well. Since you can SSH into the VM, basic networking is working, but HTTPS traffic may be restricted.
Test Connectivity: Verify if you can reach external servers without HTTPS (to isolate TLS issues):

bash

ping 8.8.8.8
curl http://archlinux.org

Switch to TAP Networking (Optional): If user-mode networking is causing issues, consider switching to TAP networking for better control. This requires root privileges on the host and setting up a bridge:
bash

# On the host, create a TAP interface
sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
sudo ip link set tap0 up
sudo ip link set tap0 master br0  # Assuming a bridge 'br0' exists

# Update QEMU command to use TAP
qemu-system-x86_64 -net nic -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no ...

Then configure the guest to use DHCP or a static IP. This may bypass some user-mode networking limitations.

4. Inspect TLS Timeout Errors
The TLS timeout could be due to:
Proxy SSL Inspection: Your company proxy might be intercepting HTTPS traffic, causing certificate mismatches. Check if the proxy provides a custom CA certificate that needs to be installed:
bash

# Add the proxy's CA certificate to the system
sudo cp company-ca-cert.pem /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-certificates

Obtain the company-ca-cert.pem from your IT department.

Clock Skew: Ensure the VM's clock is synchronized, as incorrect time can cause TLS errors:
bash

sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl status

Test with curl: Use curl to debug TLS issues:
bash

curl -v https://mirror.archlinux.org

Look for errors related to certificates, timeouts, or proxy issues in the output.

5. Update Pacman Mirrorlist
If the issue is specific to certain mirrors, refresh the mirrorlist to use more reliable or geographically closer mirrors:
bash

sudo pacman -Syy  # Refresh mirrorlist

Alternatively, manually edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist to prioritize mirrors that work better through your proxy. You can generate a new mirrorlist using:
bash

curl -s 'https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=all&protocol=https&use_mirror_status=on' | sudo tee /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

6. Bypass Proxy for Testing
If possible, test without the proxy to isolate the issue. Temporarily unset the proxy variables:
bash

unset http_proxy
unset https_proxy
sudo pacman -Syu

If this works, the proxy is likely the issue. Contact your IT department to confirm the proxy allows access to Arch Linux mirrors (e.g., https://mirror.archlinux.org).
7. Debug with Verbose Output
Run pacman with verbose output to get more details on the TLS timeout:
bash

sudo pacman -Syu --debug

Check the output for specific error messages, such as which mirror is failing or details about the TLS handshake.
8. Alternative: Use a Different Package Manager or Tool
If pacman continues to fail, try using an alternative like yay or paru (AUR helpers) to see if they handle the proxy better, or use curl/wget to manually download packages and install them with pacman -U.
9. Check Company Proxy Logs
If none of the above work, the issue may be on the proxy server side. Contact your IT department to check if:
The proxy is blocking Arch Linux mirror domains.

HTTPS traffic is being throttled or timing out.

Specific ports or protocols required by pacman are restricted.

Example QEMU Command for Reference
Ensure your QEMU command is correctly configured for networking. A typical user-mode networking setup looks like:
bash

qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2G -drive file=archlinux.qcow2,format=qcow2 -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22

Here, -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 forwards port 2222 on the host to port 22 (SSH) on the guest, allowing SSH access. Verify this setup matches your configuration.
Next Steps
Try the above steps in order, starting with verifying proxy settings and testing with wget or curl.

If the issue persists, share the exact TLS timeout error message or output from pacman -Syu --debug for more specific guidance.

If you suspect QEMU networking is the bottleneck, consider experimenting with TAP networking or consulting QEMU documentation for advanced networking options.

I have successfully installed and run a debian virtual machine inside a qemu on my corporate network. On the archlinux virtual machine in qemu, what if it is some certificate issue?

Since you’ve successfully installed and run a Debian virtual machine in QEMU on your corporate network but are facing TLS timeout errors when running pacman -Syu on an Arch Linux virtual machine, and you suspect a certificate issue, let’s focus on diagnosing and resolving potential certificate-related problems on the Arch Linux VM. The fact that Debian works suggests the corporate network and proxy setup are generally functional, but there may be specific issues with how Arch Linux handles certificates or the proxy’s SSL inspection.
Why a Certificate Issue Might Be the Cause
Corporate Proxy SSL Inspection: Many corporate proxies intercept HTTPS traffic, presenting their own certificates to clients. If the proxy’s CA certificate isn’t trusted by the Arch Linux VM, TLS handshakes will fail, causing timeouts or errors.

Missing or Outdated CA Certificates: Arch Linux may lack the necessary CA certificates to trust the proxy or the Arch Linux mirrors.

QEMU Networking Interaction: While QEMU’s user-mode networking (SLiRP) is functional for SSH, it might handle HTTPS traffic differently, potentially exacerbating certificate issues.

System Clock Issues: Incorrect system time can cause certificate validation failures, as certificates have validity periods.

Steps to Diagnose and Fix Certificate Issues on Arch Linux VM
1. Test for Certificate Issues with curl
Use curl to check if the TLS timeout is certificate-related. Run:
bash

curl -v https://mirror.archlinux.org

What to Look For:
Errors like SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate indicate the proxy’s CA certificate isn’t trusted.

Timeout errors with partial TLS handshake details suggest the proxy is interfering.

If the request succeeds, the issue may not be certificate-related.

If you see a certificate error, proceed to the next steps.
2. Check the Proxy’s CA Certificate
Corporate proxies often use a custom CA certificate for SSL inspection. Since your Debian VM works, it likely has this certificate installed. You need to install the same certificate on the Arch Linux VM.
Obtain the Proxy’s CA Certificate:
Check with your IT department for the proxy’s CA certificate (usually a .pem or .crt file).

Alternatively, if you have access to the Debian VM, export the certificate from there:
bash

# On Debian VM
sudo cp /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/company-ca.crt ~/company-ca.crt

Transfer company-ca.crt to the Arch Linux VM (e.g., via SCP or a shared folder).

Install the Certificate on Arch Linux:
Copy the certificate to the trusted CA store:
bash

sudo cp company-ca.crt /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust

This updates the system’s trusted CA certificates. Verify the certificate is recognized:
bash

trust list | grep -i company

Test Again:
Retry curl and pacman:
bash

curl -v https://mirror.archlinux.org
sudo pacman -Syu

3. Verify System CA Certificates
Ensure Arch Linux has up-to-date CA certificates. The ca-certificates package should be installed, but it may need updating:
bash

sudo pacman -S ca-certificates

If pacman fails due to the same TLS issue, manually download the package from a mirror using wget or curl (bypassing certificate checks temporarily):
bash

wget --no-check-certificate https://mirror.archlinux.org/core/os/x86_64/ca-certificates-<version>.pkg.tar.zst
sudo pacman -U ca-certificates-<version>.pkg.tar.zst

Replace <version> with the correct package version from the mirror.
4. Check System Clock
Certificate validation depends on accurate system time. A misconfigured clock can cause TLS errors. Verify the system time:
bash

timedatectl status

Enable NTP synchronization if it’s not active:
bash

sudo timedatectl set-ntp true

If the clock is significantly off, manually set it:
bash

sudo timedatectl set-time "2025-06-15 10:44:00"

Then retry pacman -Syu.
5. Configure wget for Proxy Certificates
Since pacman uses wget for downloads, ensure wget trusts the proxy’s certificate. Edit /etc/wgetrc or ~/.wgetrc:
bash

echo 'ca_certificate=/etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/company-ca.crt' >> ~/.wgetrc
echo 'use_proxy=on' >> ~/.wgetrc
echo 'http_proxy=http://proxy.company.com:1234' >> ~/.wgetrc
echo 'https_proxy=http://proxy.company.com:1234' >> ~/.wgetrc

Test wget:
bash

wget -S https://mirror.archlinux.org

If this works, retry pacman -Syu.
6. Temporarily Bypass Certificate Verification (Testing Only)
To confirm the issue is certificate-related, temporarily disable certificate checks in curl or wget. Do not use this in production:
bash

curl --insecure https://mirror.archlinux.org
wget --no-check-certificate https://mirror.archlinux.org

If this succeeds, the issue is definitely with certificate validation, and you need to install the proxy’s CA certificate.
7. Compare with Debian VM
Since the Debian VM works, compare its certificate setup with Arch Linux:
On Debian, check trusted CA certificates:
bash

ls /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

Check proxy settings in /etc/environment or /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ for clues about how Debian handles the proxy.

Replicate any relevant settings (e.g., custom CA certificates or proxy configurations) on the Arch Linux VM.
8. Debug Pacman with Verbose Output
Run pacman with debug output to get more details on the TLS error:
bash

sudo pacman -Syu --debug

Look for specific certificate errors (e.g., unable to get local issuer certificate or certificate verification failed). Share the output if you need further assistance.
9. Check Corporate Proxy Restrictions
If adding the proxy’s CA certificate doesn’t resolve the issue, the proxy might be blocking specific domains or protocols used by Arch Linux mirrors. Contact your IT department to verify:
The proxy allows access to https://mirror.archlinux.org and other Arch mirrors.

No specific TLS versions or ciphers are restricted (some proxies enforce strict TLS settings).

10. Alternative: Use HTTP Mirrors (Temporary Workaround)
If HTTPS continues to fail, configure pacman to use HTTP mirrors (less secure, use only for testing):
Edit /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist and replace https:// with http:// for a few mirrors, or generate a new mirrorlist:
bash

curl -s 'https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=all&protocol=http' | sudo tee /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

Then retry:
bash

sudo pacman -Syu

Key Differences Between Debian and Arch Linux
Package Manager: Debian’s apt may handle proxy certificates more robustly or have preconfigured corporate certificates, while pacman relies on wget and system CA certificates.

Default CA Store: Debian uses /etc/ssl/certs/, while Arch uses /etc/ca-certificates/. Ensure the proxy’s CA is in Arch’s store.

System Configuration: Debian might have corporate-specific configurations (e.g., preinstalled CA certificates) that Arch’s minimal setup lacks.

Example Workflow
Export the proxy’s CA certificate from the Debian VM.

Transfer it to the Arch Linux VM and install it:
bash

sudo cp company-ca.crt /etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust

Set proxy variables:
bash

export http_proxy="http://proxy.company.com:1234"
export https_proxy="http://proxy.company.com:1234"

Test with curl:
bash

curl -v https://mirror.archlinux.org

Run pacman:
bash

sudo pacman -Syu

If It Still Fails
Share the output of curl -v https://mirror.archlinux.org or pacman -Syu --debug for specific error details.

Confirm with your IT department whether the proxy requires additional configuration (e.g., specific TLS versions or authentication).

Consider rebuilding the Arch Linux VM from scratch, ensuring the proxy’s CA certificate is installed during setup, as the premade VM might have missing dependencies.

This should resolve most certificate-related issues. Let me know if you need further assistance or specific commands!
